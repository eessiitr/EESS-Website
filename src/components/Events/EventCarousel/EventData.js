                    College life is a rollercoaster ride filled to the brim with new experiences lessons, and countless memories. We meet many new people and develop unique bonds with each of them, be it our teachers, friends, or mentors, and out of all these, one bond which is forever cherished is the junior-senior bond for in a senior, we find a friend, a mentor, a teacher and much more. Our seniors are always there for us, lighting the path where they had trodden a year back and braved the storms along the way. Now they were about to set foot in the outside world, and it was our time to thank them for all they had done for us. 
                    <br/>
                    It is that occasion where the whole family reunites one last time to cherish the numerous memories they have had over the last four amazing years. It is attended by a variety of guests including the Head of Department(HOD), our beloved Professors and the DIRECTOR(not sure).
                    <br/>
                    Kicking off with a feedback representation by the final year UG and PG representatives we have a review of the developments and shortcomings they experienced over the years paving way for the betterments that we should make. It is followed by enlightening speeches from our HOD and our professors.
                    <br/>
                    The celebration’s just about to get better as the night is paraded with a variety of cultural performances by our pre-final and final year UG students, ranging from grooving to Bhangra beats to reminiscing to the song “ Yaaron dosti….”, the night has it all.
                    <br/>
                    The party is just isn’t finished yet as we have several other events like Title giving, the details of which are better kept a secret :). Indeed, this occasion is the best possible rendition of the bond we share.

                   EESS successfully conducted Intern Talks for Software, Research and Core profiles for second-year students to help them clear their questions, doubts, and fears regarding the same. The talk was hosted by members of EESS and chaired by their seniors who had themselves been in the same spot a year back and had excelled in flying colours in their respective fields. The host first briefed the audience about the general preparation strategy and was followed by the students asking their questions directly to the panel.
                   <br/>
                   The talk was conducted in offline mode and also acted as an icebreaker giving the students a first-hand experience of offline mode. The talk was also streamed on the EESS YouTube channel for people who couldn’t attend the talk in person.
                   <br/>
                   The importance of this talk can’t be stressed enough. INTERN SEASON - which usually takes place in the months JULY to SEPTEMBER is a very hectic and stressful time for the third-yearites, and it’s crucial to have the right guidance during this time and who’s better to lead than those who have already tasted the fights and fails in their own time. 
                   <br/>
                   Our panel consisted of superb achievers of our Department ranging from all domains. They showed the roadmap which the students could follow and the resources which can be helpful for this journey. We all know that a lot of information and materials are present but to find the right track is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Here’s where the experience of our seniors is undoubtedly the game-changer.

                    After working diligently and finally getting into IIT, the freshers are launched directly into a land of opportunities. Their fears of being exposed to the public's eyes and their judgment start creeping up and make them averse to the general idea of participation. And this is understandable since these opportunities require one to, bluntly put, "act like a grown-up." 
                    <br/>
                    This is easier said than done, and only a few can walk the talk while others may feel disillusioned and alone. To make things worse, the interactions had reduced drastically for the 'COVID' batch, right at the initial stages of their public life.
                    <br/>
                    Thus, seeing the need to help get freshers out of this predicament, EESS stepped in with a Bootcamp specially designed to enhance personality and prepare the participants to handle the challenges of this social world swiftly and confidently. The Bootcamp was conducted in February 2021.
                    <br/>
                    We received more than 300 responses from 1st year UG out of which 100 students were selected from the response form. The 4-day Bootcamp started with an engaging ice-breaking session and included multiple fun activities such as PowerPoint Karaoke, lasting impression elevator pitch, etc. 
                    <br/>
                    The Bootcamp was concluded with a speaker event by the one and only Prakhar Gupta of Prakhar ke Pravachan. The event was also streamed live on his YouTube channel. This talk was memorable and eye-opening for the students, and many were inspired by Prakhar's words to further excel and move forward.
                    <br/>
                    The overall event was a great success, and the students who attended the Bootcamp felt enhanced self-confidence, improved communication skills, and better engagement in public interaction.
